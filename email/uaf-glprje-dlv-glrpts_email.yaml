      Attached are reports results associated with monthly PRJE batch process.
      
      As a reminder, this should be the final processing item for the prior accounting
      period. Once confirmed, please inactivate the prior accounting period, which
      would prevent prior period accounting entries from posting. If any entry for
      prior period occurs after the inactivation, errors would be reported on the
      scrubber error report.
      
      Reminder:
      Accounting Periods may be found in the following location in KFS:
      Maintenance Tab --> Chart Of Accounts Section --> Accounting Period Hyperlink
