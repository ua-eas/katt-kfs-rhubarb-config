      DATE TIME - Attached is the report that shows the results and/or error
      conditions that have resulted from performing the ERE fringe calculations on the
      UAccess Employee interface files. The calculations would have occurred on
      any salary encumbrance, position budget, or payroll actuals files received.
      
      This data will be further processed with any KFS generated transactions for the
      labor ledger and ultimately will be found within the entries and balances that
      make up the labor ledger, encumbrances, and the general ledger.
