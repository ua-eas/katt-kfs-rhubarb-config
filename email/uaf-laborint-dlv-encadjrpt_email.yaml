    subject: %%ENV - UAF-LABORINT-DLV-ENCADJRPT - Salary Encumbrance Adjustments Report, FP Team Review
    message: >
      %%$DATE %%TIME - Attached is the report that shows the results and/or error
      conditions that have resulted from processing the UAccess Employee salary
      encumbrance interface file. The salary encumbrance adjustment results were
      determined based on the full salary encumbrance file received from the UAccess
      system and the current balances as they exist within the labor ledger.
      
      This data will be further processed with any KFS generated transactions for the
      labor ledger and ultimately will be found within the entries and balances that
      make up the labor ledger, encumbrances, and the general ledger.
