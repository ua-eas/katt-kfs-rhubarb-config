    message: >
      %%DATE %%TIME - The first execution of the 1099 payee extract process for the
      new year is ready to be ran, but has been placed on hold. Please review the KFS
      parameters to ensure they are set appropriately.
      
      After the parameters have been reviewed and adjustments completely approved, as
      necessary, please contact the KFS technical support team for the payee extract
      schedule (1099 Tax) to be released for execution. If the tech team does not
      receive notification today to release the jobs for processing, the nightly
      batch processing will be held up until that event occurs.
      
      Reminder, parameters can be found in KFS:
      Administration Tab --> Parameter Hyperlink
      Select KUALI-TAX in the Namespace Code field before performing the 'Search'.
