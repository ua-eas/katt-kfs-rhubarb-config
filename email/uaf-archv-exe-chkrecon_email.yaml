    message: >
      As of DATE at TIME, in ENV, the Bank Transaction processing segment has finished.
      The receipt of this email does mean that archiving of Check Recon files has completed.
      However, it does not mean that all previous jobs in the chain succeeded (owing to the
      presence of jobs that were requested to continue on failure).
