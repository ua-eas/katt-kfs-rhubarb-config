    message: >
      DATE TIME
      Attached are reports results associated with monthly PRJE batch process.
      
      As a reminder, this should be the final processing item for the prior accounting
      period. Once confirmed, please inactivate the prior accounting period, which
      would prevent prior period accounting entries from posting. If any entry for
      prior period occurs after the inactivation, errors would be reported on the
      scrubber error report.
      
      Reminder:
      Accounting Periods may be found in the following location in KFS:
      Maintenance Tab --> Chart Of Accounts Section --> Accounting Period Hyperlink

      DATE TIME - Month End processing has completed. The receipt of
      this email does mean that the Month PRJE reports were mailed out (assuming attachments
      were found). However, it does not mean that all previous jobs in the chain succeeded
      (owing to the presence of jobs that were requested to continue on failure).
