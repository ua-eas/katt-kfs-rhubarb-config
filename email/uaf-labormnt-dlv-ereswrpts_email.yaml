    subject: %%ENV - UAF-LABORMNT-DLV-ERESWRPTS - Labor Processing Report(s) AFTER Fringe Budget Sweep, FP Team Review
    message: >
      %%$DATE %%TIME - Attached are the additional reports that provide the results
      associated with the batch processing for the labor ledger after the execution
      of the ERE Budget sweep job. These reports will provide information on the
      condition of the labor ledger balances, along with a report that provides the
      summary data that will feed to the GL.
      
      This data will be further processed with the remainder of the generated ledger
      transactions from other internal and external areas and ultimately be found
      within the entries and balances that make up the general ledger.
