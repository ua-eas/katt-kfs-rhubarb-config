    subject: %%ENV - UAF-END-SUMMARIZE - SUCCESS, Weekday financial processing has completed
    message: >
      %%$DATE.%%TIME - The financial processing portion of the %%ENV nightly batch
      for today, %%$DATE, has completed at %%TIME.
      
      That means that the following jobs streams have all finished executing:
      Archibus Processing
      Core Accounting Segment
      PCard Processing Segment
      eInvoice and SciQuest processing
      Bank Transaction Processing Segment
      
      If any special schedules, such as Month End or Annual processing ran, those
      were not explicity accounted for in this email, but if they failed to compelete
      then one of the above segments would not have completed, and you would not have
      received this email. So, this implies that they too completed.
      
      The overall nightly batch should still be checked. Some jobs are designed to
      continue, even upon a KFS batch job failure status. However, by receiving this
      email it does imply that the Nightly Batch did fully execute and that no
      criical jobs have failed (those that do not continue on failure).
      
      Following this email, there are some Control-M jobs remaining, including system
      cleanup jobs and those jobs that restore user access. Once you receve an email
      that user access has been restored, the Nightly Batch for this evening is fully
      complete.
